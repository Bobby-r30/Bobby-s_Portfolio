# Bobby's Porfolio

Hi there!

I'm Bob and welcome to my portfolio page where you can find a little more about me and the work I do ðŸ˜‡.

I am a passionate football fan hailing from the UK. With a background in Business and Law, I've spent the past 5 years immersing myself in the world of Real Estate, focusing on analysis and data projects. One standout project that I had was creating a Generative Space Design AI within Real Estate.
Currently, I am within the Finance Sector managing a small team of data professionals. Looking ahead, I'm eager to further enhance my skills by pursuing a master's degree in Data and Business Analytics, all while continuing to lead impactful data projects.
